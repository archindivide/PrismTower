Intro <r1>:
You awake in blackness. Cold stone touches your face, you move to get up and 
find that your muscles ache. You try to remember where you are and how you got
here. Its warm and damp in this room, mustiness fills your nose. You remember
chasing someone through a narrow corridor, but nothing more...

	Look,listen,smell->[sense]:

	There is blackness all around you. You can hear a drip of something to your
	left. You can feel movement in the air towards your right.
	
	Leap->[Jump]:
	You hit your head on the ceiling, it is quite low.
	
	Feel,Rub,Grab(if hasn't been touched)->[Touch] floor:
	You feel a small hard object, possibly metal. There is a hole in the center
	of it.
	
	Grab(if has been touched)->[Take] object:
	You put the object in your pocket, you still aren't sure what it is.

Poison room <r2>:
(maybe more room description)
You carefully make your way to the left until you feel dripping, you are
very thristy.

	[Drink] water,liquid->[Poison]:
	Your stomach knots and you fall over in pain. Visions swim before your eyes:
	a woman leaning over you tears filling her eyes, a small child in your arms,
	the light fading from a bloodied corpse at the end of a metal shaft. An old
	voice speaks to you, "Weary traveler, will you lay down your sword?"

		[Yes]:
		"It is weighted down with years of battle (more stuff here)" GAME OVER
	
		[No]:
		"I cannot let the demons of the past weigh me down, I must press on. There
		is still so much left to be done."
		You have escaped death this time, but the world is not always so forgiving.
		Proceed with care traveler, for you have been weakened by the poison.
		
	[sense]:
	You still can't see anything, but you feel the dripping from the ceiling. 
	You try to get your bearings, but the floor is very slippery. After a few
	seconds, you slip and fall. Something is poking you in the back.

	[Touch] object:
	
	[Take] object:
